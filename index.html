Problem Description </h3> 
<p> Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, trash is continually being generated. More recently, more sustainable efforts have occurred to recycle some of the trash being produced. In 2013, Americans generated over 250 million tons of trash, 34.3 percent of which is recycled. However, according to the EPA about 75 percent of the waste is actually recyclable. </p>

<p>Our project aims to increase the amount of waste being recycled by taking the work out of sorting the trash. Studies have show that recycling rates increased when a county in Florida implemented single-stream recycling, another automated recycling method. Trash Bot will autonomously sort the trash provided into two separate bins: recyclables and non-recyclables. Compared to other trash sorting machines currently out in the market, ours will be a point of collection device instead of a sorting device used in a single stream sorting. </p>

<a id="requirements" class="anchor" href="#system-requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>System Requirements </h3> 
<p> 

<b>High Level Requirements</b><br>
SYS-R1. Device shall accept at least one trash object at a time, with the object minimum size as 2”x2”x1” and maximum size as 9”x6.5”x4”.  Objects are inserted by hand <br>
SYS-R2. Trash input slot shall be at least 40” from base of device<br>
SYS-R3. Device volume shall not exceed 42 gallons (5.6 cu. ft)<br>
SYS-R4. Device shall contain two bins, each with at least 15 gallon (2 cu. ft) storage volume.  <br>
SYS-R5. Device shall classify trash input into four categories. metal, plastic, glass, and other.  Accuracy of classification must be at least 85%.<br>
SYS-R6. Device shall keep accurate count of classified trash items, and report the count to an untrained user.  <br>
SYS-R7. Device shall store trash input into two categories. (metal, plastic, glass) and other.  Accuracy of sort/store must be at least 85%.  Other category includes non-rigid plastic with no recycling number, cement, wood, ceramics, clothes, cotton, socks, wool, cardboard, newspaper, books, magazines, and styrofoam.  <br>
SYS-R8. Device shall accept trash at an average speed of 3 seconds per item for 15 items.  <br>
SYS-R9. Device shall be able to accept a new item within 120 seconds after the last item in a 15-item batch was inserted.  <br>
SYS-R10. Time to remove, empty, and reinstall bins shall take less than 15 seconds.  <br>
SYS-R11. Device shall be safe to operate for an untrained user.<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>Coolness Factor Options:</b><br>
SYS-R12. Device shall measure and report bin fullness.<br>
SYS-R13. Device shall compress plastic and aluminum objects, but should not compress glass and “other” objects.<br>
</p>
