    <h3>Functional Architecture</h3> 

<p> 
  Based off the design requirements, our team compiled a list of four main subsections our project should incorporate, including: user interface, classification, compacting, and storing. The integration of the four subsystems is shown in the figure below. 
<br> <br>

   Overall, an object enters through the entry door into our system and sweeps past three main classification sensors, including an inductance sensor, an optical sensor bank, and a mass sensor. From these three sensors, items were classified based off a decision tree. Once the object is classified and determined if compactable, the object would fall onto the trapdoor until the accurate bin has been placed under the trapdoor. Here, the trapdoor can stay closed until compacting had occured and/or the trapdoor would open to allow the object to fall into the bin. Concurrently, the LCD screen will show the total count of objects classified since the system was powered on. <br>
